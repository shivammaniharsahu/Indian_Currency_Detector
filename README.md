# Indian_Currency_Detector


Currency Detection is an improvement over the existing Android Currency Detector. Currency API, and it's aimed to make it easier to recognise human faces in photos and videos. It can detect faces in a variety of orientations, so even if your subject's head is tilted sideways, it will be detected. Faces can also be recognised by certain landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and lips' edges. This is the most powerful API of them all because it can detect human faces. It's an ideal API for any face filter or camera app because the analysis is done on the device once the package is downloaded. Surprisingly, it can not only recognise a face but also extract its facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Because this API does not yet offer facial recognition, it cannot detect similarities between two faces, but it can classify aspects such as whether the eyes are open or closed.

Mobile Vision APIs that give new Currency Detection APIs that discover Indian currency in images and videos more accurately and quickly than before, as well as smart services like comprehending currency in varied orientations, detecting features, and interpreting images
